# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle:

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of a Gantt chart, which allows us to follow the guidelines and achieve the milestones from time to time. A Gantt chart is a project management tool that assists in planning by showing start and end dates, as well as dependencies, scheduling, and deadlines, including how much of the task is completed per stage and who is the task owner. The project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

The WBS stands for Work Breakdown Structure. It is a hierarchical representation of the elements (tasks) that comprise a project. The WBS of our project is shown below:

### Scope

As for the scope, our team has come up with a work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS consists of all the priamry tasks of the project and has the hierarchical and gradual decomposition of the project into phases, deliverables, and work plans. 

### #00ff00 Risk Chart

Risks in project management are unexpected events that may or may not occur and impact our project outcome in some way and below is the risk chart that shows some risk possibilities that may occur and how to solve it.

| Control Element | Possibilities of Risk | How to identify risk? | Actions to take |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality/Resources <br> |1. illegible handwriting and poor image quality.<br><br> 2. Varied language models | 1. Joined-up handwriting may be challenging for computers to read and certain characters in text may look very similar, which makes it difficult for a computer to recognise accurately. <br><br> 2. Variety of languages from region to region and the scope of handwriting recognition is limited.| Utilize the Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) which results low recognition accuracy and  high validation efforts|
|Budget <br> |1.  |How: The monthly bills shows unexpected extra charged to the bills.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email or discord whenever budget exceed threshold in the AWS cloud computing service.
|Timeline <br> | 1. Project not able to reach the milestone set  as described in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are not enough server to be used to run the car plate recognition model training  |How: The members are stuck with a certain problem and drag all the other team members <br><br> When: The problem will be encountered during the project excution and monitoring phase.| Ask support from the other team member and switch their task or job to other job to avoid him/her to stuck in the problem loop.|
