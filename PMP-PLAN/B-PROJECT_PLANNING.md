# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle:

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of a Gantt chart, which allows us to follow the guidelines and achieve the milestones from time to time. The project life cycle and Worsk Breakdown Structure (WBS) breaks down the tasks and work of every member into several modules. Based on the WBS, each member has their own roles and parts in each stage of the lifecycle.

Below shows the tree view of WBS. This work breakdown structure is designed to divide the technical portion of the project into several modules based on the life cycle phrase, including planning and analysis, design and implementation, testing, and requirements and maintenance.Â
