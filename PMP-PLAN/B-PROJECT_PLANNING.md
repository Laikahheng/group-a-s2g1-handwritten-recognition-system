# PROJECT OVERVIEW
## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle:

The project management life cycle is represented and documented in the form of a Gantt chart, which allows us to follow the guidelines and achieve the milestones from time to time. A Gantt chart is a project management tool that assists in planning by showing start and end dates, as well as dependencies, scheduling, and deadlines, including how much of the task is completed per stage and who is the task owner. The project management WBS is shown in the Gantt Chart below:

<img src="assets/wbs_gantt_chart2.JPG" width="100%">

The WBS stands for Work Breakdown Structure. It is a hierarchical representation of the elements (tasks) that comprise a project. The WBS of our project is shown below:

<img src="assets/wbs_tree.png" width="100%">

### Scope

As for the scope, our team has come up with a work breakdown structure (WBS). The WBS consists of all the priamry tasks of the project and has the hierarchical and gradual decomposition of the project into phases, deliverables, and work plans. 

### Risk Chart

Risks in project management are unexpected events that may or may not occur and impact our project outcome in some way and below is the risk chart that shows some risk possibilities that may occur and how to solve it.

| Control Element | Possibilities of Risk | How to identify risk? | Actions to take |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality/Resources | 1. Illegible handwriting and poor image quality <br><br> 2. Varied language models | 1. Joined-up handwriting may be challenging for computers to read and certain characters in text may look very similar, which makes it difficult for a computer to recognise accurately. <br><br> 2. Variety of languages from region to region and the scope of handwriting recognition is limited.| Utilize the Intelligent Character Recognition (ICR) which results low recognition accuracy and  high validation efforts where it allows handwritten characters to be recognised and converted by a computer into computer-readable text.|
|Budget <br> | Purchasing of optical charcter recognition tool (OCR) might exceed the planned project cost estimation.  | The billing of hardware tools might extra charges. |Lease and subscribe to OCR monthly and pay fixed amount.|
|Timeline <br> | 1. System not feasible and delivered on time as per planned in Gantt Chart <br><br> 2. Technical issues in system.  | 1. Shortage of manpower and budget restrictions. <br><br> 2. Error handling and coding error.| 1. Arrange for double shift and over time by project members. <br><br> 2.Request for extra expert technical assitance from the technical teams.|

Car Plate Recognition Project will need to the project manager to identify who we can propose our idea to and who are probably going to accept our idea. Project Manager also need to check and make sure all the initiation and planning documents such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Gantt chart are constructed in a clear and complete form. <br><br> The Project Manager is accountable for the development, maintenance, and adherence to the Project Office infrastructure and supporting methodologies (e.g. processes, procedures, standards, and templates) that are in compliance with OSI Best Practices and policies.

This includes managing the RFP or RFO development, preparing and maintaining procurement schedule, coordinating contract negotiations and managing evaluation of proposals or offers and selection of vendor. <br><br> The procurement manager needs to negotiate the contract, policies and deadlines of the project with each of the members. Moreover, procurement manager needs to ensure that no staff can buy any stuffs related using company’s money. Every expense needs to be approved by procurement manager.

For example, in car plate recognition project, the team need to extract the car plate from an image. This session might be dangerous if the team is required to take pictures on the street where car is moving very fast. Hence, this problem will be listed out and solutions will be discussed within the team. <br><br> Every step in this project might have unexpected problems. Hence the risk manager is required to list out every single risks so that they can avoid and take precaution to make sure that particular problem will not happen.
| Software Developer | Lai Kah Heng | The Administrative Manager The Administrative Manager directs the administrative staff, coordinates tools and services training, ensures that the administrative staff adhere to processes and policies, leads the cost management effort including: sponsoring cost budgeting and tracking activities, facilitating communication on fiscal status, and ensuring the project cost tool and supporting documentation is maintained. The Administrative Manager also provides reports, recommendations, and status on the project budget and expenditures, e.g., planned vs. actual reports, initiates corrective action, and re-planning activities. <br><br> After each process in car plate recognition project, the administrative manager needs to list out every possible thing that can be presented in the documentation form. For example, the activity report, and any documentation related to cost. This role is very important to make sure everyone and everything works under a standard procedure according to the documentation, and also avoid wastage in terms of time and money.|
