QTMT Inc. managed to achieve the objectives initialized since the beginning of the project. A system that is artificial intelligence powered, which uses deep-learning technique has been made. Deep learning is used in this project to identify the location of the number plate on the image and also read the characters on the number plate. 
Besides, FAST API is used to implement the python program that are used to recognise the number plate into a html website. By using this method, our objective of building an API in the system was met.
