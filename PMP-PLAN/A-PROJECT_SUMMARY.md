In Aeon Mall, conventional parking fees charging system require car driver to obtain their car ticket upon entering the mall at the barrier gate. Driver need to pay for the ticket before leaving the mall at the packing machine. 

In our car plate recognition system, a camera will be positioned at the barrier gate. The camera will automatically recognize driver's car plate number and deduct parking fees from user. In this project, our **main focus will be on the car plate detection and recognition module**. This is the very first step in developing the automatic parking system in Aeon.
