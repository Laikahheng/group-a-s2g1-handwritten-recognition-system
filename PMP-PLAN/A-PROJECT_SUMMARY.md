# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
### Project Name: 
Handwritten Recognition System

### Project Summary:
The term "handwriting recognition" (HWR) refers to a computer's or device's capacity to accept handwriting as input from sources such as printed physical documents, photographs, and other devices, or to directly enter handwriting onto a touchscreen and translate it into text. Typically, the input takes the form of an image. Consider real-time recognition using a camera for optical scanning or a photograph of handwritten text that is given to pattern-recognition software. The capacity of a computer or mobile device to recognise handwriting as actual text is known as handwriting recognition.

This project aims to develop software that will be helpful in recognising characters in the English language. The project is restricted to English characters only, but it can be further developed to recognise the characters of different languages in the future.

### Project Objectives:
+ To develop an artificial intelligence system that is able to recognise human handwriting in English
+ To convert a large volume of handwritten data into text data in a short period of time
+ To create an application programming interface (API) as the integration module for future use
