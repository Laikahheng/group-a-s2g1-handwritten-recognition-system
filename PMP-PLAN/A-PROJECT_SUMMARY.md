# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## A. DEFINING THE PROJECT
###  Project Summary
The term "handwriting recognition" (HWR) refers to a computer's or device's capacity to accept handwriting as input from sources such printed physical documents, photographs, and other devices, or to directly enter handwriting onto a touchscreen and translate it into text. Typically, the input takes the form of an image. Consider real-time recognition utilising a camera for optical scanning, or a photograph of handwritten text that is given to pattern-recognition software. The capacity of a computer or mobile device to recognise handwriting as actual text is known as handwriting recognition. 

This project aims to develop software which will be helpful in recognizing characters of English language. The project is restricted to English characters only and it can be further developed to recognize the characters of different languages in future.
