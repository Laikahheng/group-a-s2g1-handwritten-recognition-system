Handwriting Recognition Implementation Example

## Description of the project coding implementation

Firstly, we will import some useful libraries. The library needed for handwritten recognition system are numpy and cv2. NumPy aims to provide an array object that is faster and compact than traditional Python lists.  Being an Open-Source library for deep learning and machine learning, TensorFlow plays a vital role in this handwritten recognition system.

Next is to implement the architecture and structure of convolutional neural network (CNN). CNN has has three layers namely, convolutional, pooling, and a fully connected layer. It is a class of neural networks and processes data having a grid-like topology. The convolution layer is the building block of CNN carrying the main responsibility for computation of the handwritten recognition.
